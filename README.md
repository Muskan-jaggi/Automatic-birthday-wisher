# Birthday Email Sender

This script reads a CSV file containing birthday data, selects a random birthday letter template, personalizes it, and sends the birthday email to the respective individuals whose birthdays match the current date.

## Files

- `letter_templates/`: Directory containing letter templates with placeholders for the name.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library

## Setup

1. Create `birthdays.csv` with columns: `name`, `email`, `year`, `month`, `day`.
2. Create a `letter_templates` directory with text files. Use `[NAME]` as a placeholder for the recipient's name.
3. Update the email credentials in the script:
   ```python
   my_email = "your_email@example.com"
   password = "your_email_password"
   ```

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python birthday_email_sender.py
```

```
Dear [NAME],

Wishing you a very Happy Birthday! Have a fantastic day!
